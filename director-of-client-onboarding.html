  <h3>Who’s a Good Fit for this Job</h3>
  <p>We’re looking for a developer who has been involved in the sales process in some regard. For example: you may have been pulled into sales calls or you may have been involved in writing proposals. Whatever the case, you need to have a strong interest in turning leads into deals (as an aside, isn’t it interesting that those two words are anagrams?).</p>
  <p>You’ll need to be smart, independent, and ambitious to fit in here. We’re looking for someone who wants to own the onboarding process and materially impact how we do business.</p>
