		<h2>About SmartLogic</h2>
		<p>We build custom web and mobile applications.  We typically work for funded startup companies and existing businesses.</p>

		<p>If you haven't yet built your application, we work with you through all phases of the software development process - from formulating the idea through to deploying it to production servers.  Because all projects have a budget we constantly work with you to identify the highest-priority features.</p>

		<p>If you already have a production application, we can help you maintain it, add new features or modify it to allow it to scale for a larger audience.</p>

		<h3>Scoping Meeting</h3>
		
		<p>I make it sound like the goal of the scoping meeting is to serve our purposes (give us a couple months of work) as opposed to phrasing this to the client's advantage somehow.</p>
		
		<p>The goal of a scoping meeting is to build a pipeline of several weeks to months worth of work for our team.  Before the scoping meeting you'll have sent us a number of high-level features you want incorporated into your product.  After the scoping meeting we’ll deliver a set of user stories that will be added to your project's queue of stories to be developed.</p>
		
		<p>After the scoping meeting we can jump headfirst into design and development or you can use the results for other purposes (e.g. fundraising, estimation, scheduling, etc.).</p>
		
		<h3>Ongoing Design and Development</h3>
		
		<p>This is where the meat of the process kicks in.  Our team continuously works to implement all user stories that we have documented in Pivotal Tracker.  The theory is that the project is complete once there are no more stories for us to complete or once you, as the client, declare that the project is complete.  Furthermore, because all stories are prioritized within Pivotal Tracker, we continuously work on the highest-priority features.</p>
		
		<p>On a more granular level, we use the following tactics to facilitate communication throughout the course of the software development process:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Periodic Scoping Meetings:</strong> when the backlog of user stories starts to lighten up, we have a scoping meeting to give our team several weeks/months more work.</li>
			<li><strong>Weekly Iteration Meetings:</strong> each week we have an iteration meeting where we review the prior week’s worth of work and discuss priorities for the upcoming week.  Iteration meetings are typically no longer than an hour.</li>
			<li><strong>Daily Standup Meetings:</strong> standup meetings are brief - 1-10 minutes long - and serve to keep all stakeholders abreast of project progress and any obstacles impeding progress.</li>
		</ul>

				<p>The ExxonMobil Brand Asset Center (BAC) is used by ExxonMobil's various distributors that need to find and use the various brand assets created and managed by ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM). The BAC helps ensure a consistent execution of ExxonMobil's various brands; distributors go to one central repository where they can access and download any asset that they need.</p>
				
				<p>Assets can fall into one of any number of categories from Marketing Materials to Advertising to Packaging, etc. The physical assets themselves can be any file type - EPS, AI, PDF, PNG, MOV, etc.</p>
				
				<p>Users of the site first select a master brand, such as Mobil1 or Mobil Delvac. They then use an asset browser, which was built in Adobe Flex, to navigate through the hierarchy of assets in order to find the exact asset they require.</p>
